    "Question 1 : What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
    "Answer:      Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between two continuous variables: \n",
    "             one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response). The goal of SLR is to find a linear equation that best \n",
    "             predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable.\n",
    "            \n",
    "             Purpose of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "               a. Prediction: Estimate the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.\n",
    "               b. Understanding relationships: Determine the strength and direction of the relationship between X and Y.\n",
    "               c. Trend analysis: Identify how changes in the independent variable influence the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
    "Answer:      The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR) are:\n",
    "                 a. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) is linear.\n",
    "                 b. Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
    "                 c. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all values of X.\n",
    "                 d. Normality of errors: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "                 e. No multicollinearity: (In SLR, only one predictor exists, so this is inherently satisfied.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "           The mathematical equation for a Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model is:\n",
    "               Y = β0 + β1 * X + ε\n",
    "               Where:\n",
    "                    - Y : Dependent variable (what we want to predict)\n",
    "                    - X : Independent variable (predictor)\n",
    "                    - β0 : Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
    "                    - β1 : Slope (change in Y for a one-unit change in X)\n",
    "                    - ε : Error term (difference between the observed and predicted Y)\n",
    "           This equation represents a straight line where Y changes linearly with X, and ε accounts for variability not explained by X.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
    "Answer:     A real-world example of Simple Linear Regression is predicting a person's **monthly electricity bill (Y)** \n",
    "            based on their **electricity consumption in units (X)**. \n",
    "            Here:\n",
    "               - X (Independent variable) = Number of electricity units consumed\n",
    "               - Y (Dependent variable) = Monthly electricity bill amount\n",
    "            By using SLR, we can estimate how much a person's bill will increase for each additional unit of electricity consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
    "Answer:     The **method of least squares** is a technique used in linear regression to find the best-fitting line \n",
    "            through the data points. \n",
    "            It works by **minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences** (errors) between the observed values \n",
    "            and the values predicted by the linear model.\n",
    "            Mathematically, it minimizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "                   Σ (Yi - (β0 + β1*Xi))^2\n",
    "\n",
    "           Where:\n",
    "                - Yi = observed value of the dependent variable\n",
    "                - Xi = value of the independent variable\n",
    "                - β0 = intercept\n",
    "                - β1 = slope\n",
    "           This ensures that the regression line is as close as possible to all the data points in terms of squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
    "Answer:     Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for predicting a binary outcome (such as Yes/No, 0/1) \n",
    "            based on one or more independent variables. Instead of predicting a continuous value, it estimates the \n",
    "            probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Differences from Linear Regression:\n",
    "            1. Output type:  \n",
    "            - Linear Regression predicts a continuous variable.  \n",
    "            - Logistic Regression predicts a probability (between 0 and 1) and maps it to discrete classes.\n",
    "            2. Equation:  \n",
    "            - Linear: Y = β0 + β1*X + ε  \n",
    "            - Logistic: log(p/(1-p)) = β0 + β1*X, where p is the probability of the outcome.\n",
    "            3. Error distribution:  \n",
    "            - Linear Regression assumes normally distributed errors.  \n",
    "            - Logistic Regression uses a binomial distribution for errors.\n",
    "            4. Use case:  \n",
    "            - Linear Regression: predicting sales, price, temperature, etc.  \n",
    "            - Logistic Regression: predicting pass/fail, disease/no disease, spam/not spam, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 7: Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
    "Answer:  1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "          - Measures the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "          - Formula: MAE = (1/n) * Σ |Yi - Ŷi|\n",
    "          - Lower MAE indicates better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "         2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "          - Measures the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "          - Formula: MSE = (1/n) * Σ (Yi - Ŷi)^2\n",
    "          - Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. R-squared (R²):\n",
    "         - Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.\n",
    "         - Formula: R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)\n",
    "         - Value ranges from 0 to 1; higher values indicate a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 8: What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
    "Answer:     R-squared (R²) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) \n",
    "            that is explained by the independent variable(s) (X) in the regression model.\n",
    "            Purpose:\n",
    "                   - Indicates how well the regression model fits the data.\n",
    "                   - Ranges from 0 to 1:\n",
    "                        - 0 means the model explains none of the variability in Y.\n",
    "                        - 1 means the model explains all the variability in Y.\n",
    "                  - Helps assess the predictive power of the model: higher R² means a better fit.\n",
